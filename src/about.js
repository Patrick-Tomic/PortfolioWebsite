When I was in highschool I was unsure what I wanted to do with my life until senior year when I got into APCS and learned Java. I quickly learned it was what I wanted to do for majority of my life. I always loved building since I was a kid, and coding keeps my inner child alive. I try to keep myself as busy as possible day in and day out, and try to think of programming as my number one priority. Hoping to eventually start my own company that could branch out into variety of work. I am building great connections with people and trying to help as many as I can. I have a beautiful girlfriend that I love with my whole heart and we share a townhome with two dogs named Delilah and Nemo and my brother Dean.'
