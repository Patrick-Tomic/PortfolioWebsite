When I was in highschool I was unsure what I wanted to do with my life until senior year when I got into APCS and learned Java. I quickly learned it was what I wanted to do for majority of my life. I always loved building since I was a kid, and coding keeps my inner child alive. I try to keep myself as busy as possible day in and day out, and try to think of programming as my number one priority. Hoping to eventually start my own company that could branch out into variety of work. I am building great connections with people and trying to help as many as I can. I have a beautiful girlfriend that I love with my whole heart and we share a townhome with two dogs named Delilah and Nemo and my brother Dean.'

    buildBooks('Atomic Habits', 'Written by James Clear<br><br> was a benefical book for me that taught me how to build positive habits incrementally each day. Was a big help for me to keep coding'
    )
    buildBooks('The Autobiography of Malcom X','Written by Alex Haley<br><br>This book taught me alot about the United states during the early periods before the civil rights movement and also about the misunderstood Malcom X. Learned about the creation of the Nation of Islam, and how profound Malcoms life was. ')
    buildBooks('The 5 AM Club','Written by Robin Sharma<br><br>A great read creating a narritive that is full of information about greats, showed the benefits of waking up early and starting your day before the sun rises. Currently writing this at 4 am so I think it did a good job :)')
    buildBooks('The Hobbit','Written by J.R.R Tolkien<br><br> A classic story that was nothing like the movie')
    buildBooks('Deep Work',`Written by Cal Newport<br><br> A book covering the topic of "Deep Work". This was a good read informing me of the benefit of creating a distraction free environment that allows you to work with deepness. The use of tactics such as 'Pomodoro' are very helpful for pacing yourself and allowing periods for you to rest`)
    buildBooks('Cant Hurt Me','By David Goggins<br><br> This book covers alot of the life of the retired Navy Seal David Goggins. I got out of this book the idea of a trudge through mentality where I learned to keep pushing through hardship and break through barriers set by yourself')
    buildBooks('Don Quixote', 'Written by Miguel de Cervantes<br><br> This one was the book of the year for me. I loved the story and the imagery presented from the author was amazing. Honestly the funniest book I have read and was sad to finish it and put it down. Will definetly be reading again')
    buildBooks('Wuthering Heights','Written by Emily BrontÃ«<br><br> A classic portraying love, deception, and a variety of emotion. Heathcliff was honestly the best antagonist I have seen in a while. Good read')
    buildBooks('Animal Farm', 'Written by George Orwell<br><br> A good reread after a bit of time, was interesting seeing the comparison of certain political systems to the setting of the book')
