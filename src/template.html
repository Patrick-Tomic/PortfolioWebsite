    <p class="whoAmI">My name is Patrick Emanuel Tomic, I am a first generation Bosnian American and I have alot of ambitions to better the world. My first major ambition is to be a programmer! I have learned basic web development skills and my goal is to be able to learn as much as I can in this field before I move on to other things. I love programming and really enjoy the challenges that come with working on code, I am most excited to tackle my first long term job, but while I wait I will be learning.</p>
