      <h2 > My name is Patrick Emanuel Tomic </h2>
      <p>I am a student at the University of South Florida and I graduate in the Spring of 2024<br>
      with a Bachelors degree in Information Science<br>
      I am a man with alot of ambition to better the world, and am the first of my family to be<br>
      born in America. I spend as much time as I can learning how to develop websites everyday<br>
      It is not just fun for me but brings immense satisfaction when I can build and design something<br>
      that I know is good. I love helping people as well and I am looking for a opportunity to show <br>
      my skillset and learn through others</p>
